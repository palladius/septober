Idea here is to launch septober as in / in a new /var/www/app-volume so wehn you call docker tun bash 
you can easily troubleshoot the differences from "OLD working copy" and "NEW not working copy".
Basically the genius idea i had below the shower is to treat existing /var/www as gospel, and
try everything on a NEW dir where maybe Gemfile does NOT work with old libs.. and we need to learn to install them.
