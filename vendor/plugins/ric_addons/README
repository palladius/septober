RicAddons
=========

This is Riccardo Carlesso second plugin (first to be on a project on its own).

RicAddons v. 0.2.2 I think. This is not DRY. To be sure look at [VERSION] file.

INSTALL
=======

* Rails 2:  script/plugin install git@github.com:palladius/ric_addons.git
* Rails 3:   rails plugin install git@github.com:palladius/ric_addons.git

To take advantage of it (until I dont understand how it works u have to manually symlink, sigh!)

- copy the layout from vendor/plugins/ric_addons/lib/app/views/layout/application.html.erb
- ln -s:  app/views/ric_addons/ to vendor/plugins/ric_addons/lib/app/views/ric_addons/ 

* Routes:

  See config/routes.rb here..
 
* application_controller.rb:

 include Searchable
 
* Inject stuff into your projects:
 $ ln -s /path/to/ric_addons/skel/lib/tasks/ric_addons.thor /your_app/lib/tasks/
 $ thor list 
 $ thor ric_addons:copy_files  # should do the trick
 
 Why didnt I use a generator? Maybe it was too overwhelming.. maybe Ive just seen the RB nice tutorial on Thor ;)

TODO
====

Here more stuff: http://www.themodestrubyist.com/2010/03/05/rails-3-plugins---part-2---writing-an-engine/
You can create a ric_admin/ page with lots of auto stuff (like graphs E/R and stuff).

* Naive Search Page and naive search partial..!
